what is Docker

Docker is an open-source platform that allows developers to build, package, and run applications inside containers. Containers are lightweight, portable, and isolated environments that ensure an application runs the same way on any system, without worrying about dependencies or configurations

Why Use Docker? 🤔

"Works on my machine" problem solved – No more environment mismatches.
✅ Fast Deployment – Much faster than traditional virtual machines (VMs).
✅ Isolation – Each application runs in its own container without affecting others.
✅ Lightweight – Uses fewer system resources compared to VMs.
✅ Cross-platform & Cloud-friendly – Runs on any OS and integrates with AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud.
