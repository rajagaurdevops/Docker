# what is Docker

Docker is an open-source platform that allows developers to build, package, and run applications inside.containers<br>
Containers are lightweight, portable, and isolated environments that ensure an application<br>
runs the same way on any system, without worrying about dependencies or configurations<br>

# Why Use Docker? 🤔

Works on my machine problem solved –>  No more environment mismatches<br>
1 Fast Deployment –>  Much faster than traditional virtual machines (VMs)<br>
2 Isolation –>  Each application runs in its own container without affecting others<br>
3 Lightweight –>  Uses fewer system resources compared to VMs<br>
4 Cross-platform & Cloud-friendly –>  Runs on any OS and integrates with AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud<br>

# key concept of docker

1️ Docker Image –> A blueprint containing everything needed to run an app (OS, dependencies, code)<br>
2️ Docker Container –> A running instance of a Docker image<br>
3️ Dockerfile –> A file that defines how to build a Docker image<br>
4️ Docker Hub –> A repository for storing and sharing Docker images<br>
5️ Docker Compose –> A tool to manage multiple containers at once<br>

# what is docker file
